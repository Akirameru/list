[Lenovo Legion Tower 5i - $950 
**This is available in Lawrence**](https://www.bestbuy.com/site/lenovo-legion-tower-5i-gaming-desktop-intel-core-i5-11400-8gb-memory-nvidia-geforce-gtx-1660-super-256gb-ssd-1tb-hdd-raven-black/6453877.p?skuId=6453877)

Same price as the other desktop you guys bought. This one has the same graphics card.
The CPU is just a smidge better then the other one.
Biggest issue on this one is that it only has 8GB of ram. 16GB is recommended.
Anything more then 16GB actually does nothing to help performance.

Intel i5-11400
8 GB of RAM
GTX 1660 Super
256GB SSD + 1TB HDD

Same as the Lenovo just has more RAM. Should perform a little better.

Intel i5 10400F
16 GB of RAM

[ABS Master - $1,099](https://www.newegg.com/abs-ali524/p/N82E16883360129)

For the price this is probably the best thing you can get.
The graphics card is really good and will be able to run anything. 
Really fast CPU as well.
